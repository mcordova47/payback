## Manage Credit Card Bills
Payback is an app for my personal use for managing credit card payments.  Add accounts to pay from, upload a CSV of transactions (only Chase and Capital One are supported currently) and see a table of transactions.  Selecting an option from the list of accounts next to a transaction recalculates the total owed per account.
